## Agenda:

"There is never a right architecture - It all depends on your use case"

In this brief talk we'll talk about how products are to be architected and most importantly, how they should not be architected. We will take few problem statements, and do the tech stack analysis, and make decisions on the fly. We will also see how the big shots do product architecture (case studies).
